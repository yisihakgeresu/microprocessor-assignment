 <h2>Microprocessor Technology 2022/23</h2>

     <P>

            It’s a new year, and like clockwork, 2022 has brought with it a plethora of new chips for laptops, desktops, phones, and more. 

Intel announced new CPUs for virtually every product it makes, AMD refreshed its
 laptop processors and graphics cards for its whole lineup and started teasing its
 next major desktop overhaul, and Nvidia came out swinging with the announcement 
its most powerful GPU yet. If you weren’t keeping up (or even if you were) it was
 a lot. And that was just CES: Qualcomm already announced its next-gen chips for 
smartphones and laptops in December, and Samsung is teeing up a new Exynos 
too.
 And that’..............

 <h2>Vacuum tube</h2>
     <p>

        Alternatively called an electron tube or 
valve and first developed by John Ambrose 
Fleming in 1904. The vacuum tube is a glass tube 
with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. Vacuum tubes contain
 electrodes for controlling electron flow and were used
 in early computers as a switch or an amplifier.
 The picture shows a collection of
 different vacuum tubes used with different devices.</p>

 <h2>Evolusionary of sensors</h2>
     <p>
 
        Since the first P-N-P Germanium transistor was invented in 1947, 
semiconductor laboratories and companies have been providing 
electronics industry with 70+ kinds of 
semiconductor devices for rectifying, amplifying, switching, 
memory, lighting, actuating, sensing, energy harvesting and so on. 
Diodes and metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors are widely used in
 mass volume, from power management to computing, in applications ranging
 from consumer to industrial. Meanwhile, major sensing devices evolved mainly
 in specific applications such as control systems, medical instruments, and automotive. 
The semiconductor sensor industry has carved out a specialty niche thanks to
 multi-principal state-of-the-art of device physics, analogue circuitry design 
and production technology that lies outside the traditional fabless-foundry business model.

 <h2>ARM</h2>
     <p>
    
        The ARM microcontroller stands for Advance RISC Machine; it is one of the
 extensive and most licensed processor 
cores in the world. The first ARM processor was developed 
 in the year 1978 by Cambridge University, and the first ARM 
processor was produced by the Acorn Group of Computers in the year 1985. 
These processors are specifically used in portable devices like digital 
cameras, mobile phones, home networking modules and wireless communication
 technologies and other embedded systems due to the benefits, such as low 
consumption, reasonable performance, etc.
